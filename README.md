# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Introduction:
This project focuses on using machine learning (ML) to predict heart disease risk based on clinical data. We leverage a comprehensive dataset comprising patient demographics, physiological measurements, lifestyle factors, and diagnostic test results.

Approach:
We conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and relationships. Then, we employ various ML algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and gradient boosting machines (GBM), for model development. Hyperparameters are optimized via techniques like grid search or random search.

Evaluation:
Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves. Cross-validation techniques ensure robustness and generalization, with separate test datasets used for validation.

Results:
Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of ML in predicting heart disease risk. Results showcase the performance of different models, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and feature importance. Challenges encountered are discussed, along with potential future improvements.

Conclusion:
Using ML techniques, we've developed accurate models for heart disease prediction, contributing to early diagnosis and intervention efforts in healthcare.
